Just my luck, no ice. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. You really think you can fly that thing? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. I was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You really think you can fly that thing?

I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Did he just throw my cat out of the window?

We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
